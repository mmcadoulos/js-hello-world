/*  
Welcome, new coder. 
Enter your code on line 7 to print 'Hello, World!' 
to the console (the panel on the right)
*/

console.log('Hello World!'); console.log("message 2", '"electric '+'boogaloo"')
console.log('I shall type up the number "8"',"on a separate line by using an equation");console.log(256/32)

/*  
Next, PLAY! 
Modify your code on line 7 to try to accomplish the tasks listed below:

   1. Change the message that is printed.
      Done
   2. Figure out what the parentheses do. Will the code work without them?
      No
   3. Remove one or both quotation marks. Do we need to include both opening and closing quote marks? Is there a difference between using a single or a double quote (' vs. ")?
      Opening and closing are necessary. No difference between ' and "
   4. Remove the semi-colon, ;.
      Semi-colon ends line
   5. Print a number. (Bonus: Print two numbers added together).
      Print numbers/equations by typing inside without quotes
   6. Print multiple messages one after the other.
      console.log("message 1"+"message 2")
   7. Print two messages on the same line.
      console.log("message 1", "message 2")
   8. Print a message that contains quote marks, such as Quoth the Raven "Nevermore".
   9. Other. You choose!
